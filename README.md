# arch-packages
Some Arch Linux AUR packages I'm mantaining.

## PyMC3

This packages install the Monte Carlo bayesian modelling library [pymc3](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/).
- python-pymc3: installs the [latest release](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/releases/tag/v3.0beta) from github. Notice that this version has many problems that are already solved in the current master branch. It's recommended that you install the python-pymc3-git package.
- python-pymc3-git: installs the latest code from the [master branch](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/tree/master) from the github repository.
